Minimum Size Subarray Sum : return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target
Find K Closest Elements : return the k closest integers to x in the array. 
Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero : remove element from front or back and subtract that from X, finally we need 0 value for x
Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency : every element in the subarray have to be <= k frequency
Get Equal Substrings Within Budget : s[i] to t[j] cost ascii value difference and we have budget as maxCost
Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least K Times : max element of whole array, not just the subarray
Sliding Window Maximum : Move the window and return the max at each window
Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous : [1,10,100,1000] -> [1, 2, 3, 4]. Any number can be changed to any number. no need to be asc order, but the max and min have to be n-1 length and all numbers are unique
