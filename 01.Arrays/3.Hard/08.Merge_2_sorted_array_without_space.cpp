/*
QUESTION:
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

optimal 1) 
The idea was arr1 max <= arr2 min
It was not given that it should be *sorted* in the end. Elements will be in desc order in arr2
If arr1[left] > arr2[right]: We will swap the elements and move the pointers to the next positions.
If arr1[left] <= arr2[right]: We will stop moving the pointers as arr1[] and arr2[] are containing correct elements. 

void merge(long long arr1[], long long arr2[], int n, int m) {

    //Declare 2 pointers:
    int left = n - 1;
    int right = 0;

    //Swap the elements until arr1[left] is
    // smaller than arr2[right]:
    while (left >= 0 && right < m) {
        if (arr1[left] > arr2[right]) {
            swap(arr1[left], arr2[right]);
            left--, right++;
        }
        else {
            break;
        }
    }

    // Sort arr1[] and arr2[] individually:
    sort(arr1, arr1 + n);
    sort(arr2, arr2 + m);
}

Time Complexity: O(min(n, m)) + O(n*logn) + O(m*logm), where n and m are the sizes of the given arrays.
Reason: O(min(n, m)) is for swapping the array elements. And O(n*logn) and O(m*logm) are for sorting the two arrays.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

optimal 2) Gap method or shell sort

void swapIfGreater(long long arr1[], long long arr2[], int ind1, int ind2) {
    if (arr1[ind1] > arr2[ind2]) {
        swap(arr1[ind1], arr2[ind2]);
    }
}

void merge(long long arr1[], long long arr2[], int n, int m) {
    // len of the imaginary single array:
    int len = n + m;

    // Initial gap:
    int gap = (len / 2) + (len % 2);

    while (gap > 0) {
        // Place 2 pointers:
        int left = 0;
        int right = left + gap;
        while (right < len) {
            // case 1: left in arr1[]
            //and right in arr2[]:
            if (left < n && right >= n) {
                swapIfGreater(arr1, arr2, left, right - n);
            }
            // case 2: both pointers in arr2[]:
            else if (left >= n) {
                swapIfGreater(arr2, arr2, left - n, right - n);
            }
            // case 3: both pointers in arr1[]:
            else {
                swapIfGreater(arr1, arr1, left, right);
            }
            left++, right++;
        }
        // break if iteration gap=1 is completed:
        if (gap == 1) break;

        // Otherwise, calculate new gap:
        gap = (gap / 2) + (gap % 2);
    }
}

Time Complexity: O((n+m)*log(n+m)), where n and m are the sizes of the given arrays.
Reason: The gap is ranging from n+m to 1 and every time the gap gets divided by 2. So, the time complexity of the outer loop will be O(log(n+m)). 
Now, for each value of the gap, the inner loop can at most run for (n+m) times. So, the time complexity of the inner loop will be O(n+m). 
So, the overall time complexity will be O((n+m)*log(n+m)).

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
