/*
Question: Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it,
return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
*/

/*
Approach:
- Perform a level order traversal of the binary tree.
- For each level, keep track of the last node encountered (the rightmost node from the viewer's perspective).
- Add the value of the last node at each level to the result.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space complexity: O(M), where M is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the tree.

CODE:-
*/
vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return {};

    vector<int> ans;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int n = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            TreeNode* curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (curr->left) {
                q.push(curr->left);
            }
            if (curr->right) {
                q.push(curr->right);
            }
            // Add only the last node of the level to the answer for right view in case of left view push only the first element
            if (i == n - 1) {
                ans.push_back(curr->val);
            }
        }
    }

    return ans;

/*
It uses a helper function recursionRight that traverses the tree.
For each level, it first checks if the level already has a node in the result vector. If not, it adds the current nodeâ€™s value as the first visible node at that level.
It prioritizes the right child before the left child to ensure the rightmost node is added first.
Traversal: The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) with right-to-left traversal, ensuring the rightmost node at each level is added to the result.
