Selection Sort
/*
Start with the first element as the current position.
Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
Swap the minimum element with the element at the current position.
-> Here, startIndex(j) gets decreased by 1 each time
*/

        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIdx])
                minIdx = j;
        }
        swap(arr[i], arr[minIdx]); // Swap the smallest element with the first unsorted element
    }
}
/*
Time Complexity: O(n^2) (best, worst, and average cases).
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
Stability: Not stable (relative order of equal elements may change).

Index:  0   1   2   3
Array:  4a  4b  3   2

Index:  0   1   2   3
Array:  2   4b  3   4a

Order got changed here

Bubble Sort
/*
Start at the beginning of the array.
Compare each pair of adjacent elements:
    If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
After one pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.
Repeat for the remaining unsorted portion of the array.
Stop when no swaps are made during a pass (array is sorted).
-> Here, endIndex(j) gets decreased by 1 each time
*/
void bubbleSort(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        bool swapped = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        if (!swapped) // If no swaps in a pass, array is sorted
            break;
    }
}
/*
Time Complexity: O(n^2) (worst/average), O(n) (best case if already sorted).
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
Stability: Stable (relative order of equal elements remains unchanged).

In Insertion Sort, when an element (the key) is compared to elements on its left, it is only inserted into the position 
where it is smaller than the left elements. Importantly, when equal elements are encountered, no swapping happens.
*/
________________________________

Recursive Bubble Sort :
/*
Perform a single pass through the array, comparing and swapping adjacent elements if needed.
After the pass, the largest element will have moved to its correct position.
Recursively call the function to sort the remaining unsorted part of the array (excluding the last element, as it's already sorted).
SC : O(n) due to recursion stack.
*/
void recursiveBubbleSort(vector<int>& arr, int n) {
    // Base case: If array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted
    if (n == 1)
        return;

    // Perform one pass through the array
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            // Swap if elements are in the wrong order
            swap(arr[i], arr[i + 1]);
        }
    }

    // Recursively call the function for the first n-1 elements
    recursiveBubbleSort(arr, n - 1);
}

Insertion Sort
/*
Start from the second element (index 1) as the key.
Compare the key with the elements in the sorted portion of the array (to its left).
Shift elements larger than the key one position to the right.
Insert the key into its correct position in the sorted portion.
Repeat steps 2-4 for all elements in the array.
*/
void insertionSort(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;

        // Shift elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            --j;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key; // Place key in its correct position
    }
}
/*
Time Complexity: O(n^2) (worst/average), O(n) (best case if already sorted).
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
Stability: Stable (relative order of equal elements remains unchanged).

In Bubble Sort, adjacent elements are repeatedly compared, and if the current element is greater than the next, 
they are swapped. However, when two elements are equal, no swap occurs between them.
*/

Recursive Insertion Sort :
/*
Sort the first n-1 elements recursively.
Insert the nth element into the sorted portion of the array by shifting larger elements to the right.
The base case occurs when the array has one element or no elements.
*/

void recursiveInsertionSort(vector<int>& arr, int n) {
    // Base case: If the array has one or zero elements, it's already sorted
    if (n <= 1)
        return;

    // Recursively sort the first n-1 elements
    recursiveInsertionSort(arr, n - 1);

    // Insert the nth element into its correct position in the sorted portion
    int key = arr[n - 1];
    int j = n - 2;

    // Shift elements of arr[0..n-2] that are greater than key
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
        --j;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = key;
}
/*
Bubble : first the last element is kept in its correct place
R bubble : same 
Insertion : first the left most element is kept in its correct place
R Insertion : last the last element is placed in its place
*/

Merge Sort :

/*
Divide and Conquer: Merge Sort follows the divide and conquer paradigm. The array is 
    recursively divided into two halves, sorted, and then merged back together.
Recursive Process: The array is divided into two halves until each sub-array has one element. 
    Then, these sub-arrays are merged back in sorted order.
*/

    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    // Create temporary arrays for the left and right halves
    vector<int> leftArr(n1), rightArr(n2);

    // Copy data into temp arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
        leftArr[i] = arr[left + i];
    for (int i = 0; i < n2; ++i)
        rightArr[i] = arr[mid + 1 + i];

    // Merge the temp arrays back into the original array

        merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

int main() {
    mergeSort(arr, 0, n - 1);
}

/*
Stability: Merge Sort is stable, meaning the relative order of equal elements is preserved.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (best, worst, and average).
Space Complexity: O(n) because it requires extra space for the temporary arrays during merging.
Not In-Place: Merge Sort requires additional space to store temporary arrays during the merge process.
*/

Quick Sort :
/*
Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array (commonly the last element).
Partition: Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
Recursion: Recursively apply the same steps to the left and right sub-arrays.
*/

    // Pivot is the last element
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1;

    for (int j = low; j < high; ++j) {
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {      // swap all the arr[j] which have <= pivot value to left side and keep pivot on i+1 side
            ++i;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
