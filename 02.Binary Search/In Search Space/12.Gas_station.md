Questions:-
We have an horizontal number line. On that number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where N = size of the stations array. Now, we add K more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized. We have to find the smallest possible value of D. Find the answer exactly to 2 decimal places.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
K = 9
Output: 0.50
Explanation: Each of the 9 stations can be added mid way between all the existing adjacent stations.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
stations = [3,6,12,19,33,44,67,72,89,95]
K = 2
Output: 14.00
Explanation: Construction of gas stations at 86 locations

Approach:
- To minimize the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, we can perform binary search on the possible range of distances.
- Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the maximum distance between adjacent existing gas stations.
- While `high - low` is greater than a small threshold (e.g., 1e-6), calculate the mid-point `mid` between `low` and `high`.
- Check if it is possible to add `K` additional gas stations such that the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations is less than or equal to `mid`.
  - Iterate over the existing gas stations and check the distance between adjacent stations.
  - If the total number of additional stations required is less than or equal to `K`, it is possible to achieve the maximum distance `mid`.
- If it is possible, update `high` to `mid`, as we are looking for smaller distances.
- Otherwise, update `low` to `mid`.
- Finally, return the value of `low` plus a small value (e.g., 0.000001) to represent the answer to 2 decimal places.

Time Complexity: O(N log M), where N is the number of existing gas stations and M is the range of distances between adjacent gas stations.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using constant extra space.

# 1. Heap method
```cpp
First, we will declare an array ‘howMany[]’ of size n-1, to keep track of the number of placed gas stations and a priority queue that uses max heap.
We will insert the first n-1 indices with the respective distance value, arrr[i+1]-arr[i] for every index.
Next, using a loop we will pick k gas stations one at a time.
Then we will pick the first element of the priority queue as this is the element with the maximum distance. Let’s call the index ‘secInd’.
Now we will place the current gas station at ‘secInd’(howMany[secInd]++) and calculate the new section length,
new_section_length = initial_section_length / (number_of_stations_ inserted+1)
            = (arr[secInd+1] - arr[secInd]) / (howMany[i] + 1)
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long double minimiseMaxDistance(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size(); //size of array.
    vector<int> howMany(n - 1, 0);          // Game Changer
    priority_queue<pair<long double, int>> pq;

    //insert the first n-1 elements into pq
    //with respective distance values:
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        pq.push({arr[i + 1] - arr[i], i});
    }

    //Pick and place k gas stations:
    for (int gasStations = 1; gasStations <= k; gasStations++) {
        //Find the maximum section
        //and insert the gas station:
        auto tp = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        int secInd = tp.second;

        //insert the current gas station:
        howMany[secInd]++;

        long double inidiff = arr[secInd + 1] - arr[secInd];
        long double newSecLen = inidiff / (long double)(howMany[secInd] + 1);
        pq.push({newSecLen, secInd});
    }

    return pq.top().first;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 4;
    long double ans = minimiseMaxDistance(arr, k);
    cout << "The answer is: " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

# 2. Binary Search method
```cpp
Min possible distance: 0 (all stations at one point).
Max possible distance: max gap between consecutive stations.
The answer lies in [0, max_gap], which is a sorted, real-number space.

while(low <= high): The condition 'while(low <= high)' inside the 'while' loop won't work for decimal answers, and using it might lead to a TLE error. To avoid this, we can modify the condition to 'while(high - low > 10^(-6))'. This means we will only check numbers up to the 6th decimal place. Any differences beyond this decimal precision won't be considered, as the question explicitly accepts answers within 10^-6 of the actual answer.

1. You may never hit exact equality due to small rounding errors.
E.g., low might be 0.3333333 and high might be 0.3333334, but low != high, and due to rounding, they never converge in exact binary terms.

2. Tiny differences could cause infinite loop or excessive iterations.
The condition low <= high might be true for a long time, but the difference between them could be meaningless — like 1e-12, which is way smaller than what's required.

low = mid+1: We have used this operation to eliminate the left half. But if we apply the same here, we might ignore several decimal numbers and possibly our actual answer. So, we will use this: low = mid.
similarly high = mid-1

We count the required no. of new gas stations to make maximum distance between 2 gas stations in future as cnt, and compare cnt, k and adjust low, high

For each section between i and i-1, we will do the following:
No. of stations = (arr[i]-arr[i-1]) / dist

Let's keep in mind a crucial edge case: if the section_length (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) is completely divisible by 'dist', the actual number of stations required will be one less than what we calculate.
if (arr[i]-arr[i-1] == (No. of stations*dist): No. of stations -= 1.

mid = (low+high) / 2.0 
Not simple 2  ??
Using **2.0** ensures that the division is done in floating-point (decimal) arithmetic, not integer division.
But actually not a big issue
```
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int numberOfGasStationsRequired(long double dist, vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size(); // size of the array
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int numberInBetween = ((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) / dist);
        if ((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) == (dist * numberInBetween)) {
            numberInBetween--;
        }
        cnt += numberInBetween;
    }
    return cnt;
}
    
long double minimiseMaxDistance(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size(); // size of the array
    long double low = 0;
    long double high = 0;

    //Find the maximum distance:
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        high = max(high, (long double)(arr[i + 1] - arr[i]));
    }

    //Apply Binary search:
    long double diff = 1e-6 ;
    while (high - low > diff) {
        long double mid = (low + high) / (2.0);
        int cnt = numberOfGasStationsRequired(mid, arr);
        if (cnt > k) {
            low = mid;
        }
        else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    return high;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 4;
    long double ans = minimiseMaxDistance(arr, k);
    cout << "The answer is: " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```
